# AlphaZero_Checkers_Python
A Working AlphaZero Implementation That plays Checker and/or TicTacToe

This project is part of my bachelor thesis, which is therefore not done yet. Expected deadline 15-05-2019. This is the base premis of what works so far. It is capable of beating MCTS in checkers, however there is still some improvements to be made.
